# YouTube Desktop
I made this YouTube Desktop app because sometimes, I have trouble accessing YouTube uing a browser, specailly if you have a low-end PC and/or slow internet because your neighbor's WIFI password has changed (Just kidding), so I ONLY converted YouTube to a desktop app for Windows 10, I will tell you the controls later

There is no way I work with YouTube, I ONLY converted YouTube to a Desktop app. You have FULL permission to modify it, edit it, or even republish it (but please, don't reuse the name I used)

I made this YouTube Desktop app using Nativefier, and Nativefier also uses Electron, and I made a setup wizard with Inno Setup Complier

5. Choose a root folder to install the app, and/or just click "Next"
6. NOTE: at least 322.3 MB of free space is required

8. You will see a list of tasks, then click "Install"
9. Wait for the installation to be completed, it should be a few minutes
10. You will see a note, read it (you will need it), then click "Next"
11. You have successfully install YouTube for Desktop
12. You can launch YouTube now or later
## Install Instructions (.zip)
